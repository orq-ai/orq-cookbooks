Orq provides a robust solution for transforming these images into actionable data. This guide walks through the process of encoding images, sending them to Orq for processing, and extracting structured outputs efficiently. Whether it’s a handful of receipts or a large batch, this workflow ensures accuracy and scalability.\n",

Below, we’ll run through the code step by step for further explanation.\n",
