## **AI-Powered Data Extraction and Processing Notebooks**

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate and facilitate AI-powered data extraction and processing tasks through Orq.ai. Each notebook serves a specific purpose, from extracting structured data from unstructured sources to generating SQL queries from natural language inputs.

### 1. Data_Extraction_PDF_Invoices.ipynb

This notebook focuses on extracting structured data from PDF invoices. 
Key Features:

* Supports a variety of invoice templates.

* Provides pre-processing steps for noisy or low-quality PDFs.

* Outputs data in CSV or JSON format.

### 2. Image_Based_Receipt_Extraction.ipynb

This notebook extracts data from images of receipts.

Key Features:

* Identifies merchant names, transaction dates, and itemized costs.

* Handles image distortion and varying lighting conditions.

* Outputs data in user-friendly formats like JSON.

### 3. Intent_Classification.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify user intents from text inputs. It is designed for applications like chatbots and customer support automation.

Key Features:

* Uses pre-trained language models for high accuracy.

* Supports custom intent categories.

* Provides a confusion matrix and other metrics to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Text_to_SQL.ipynb

This notebook showcases the capability of transforming natural language queries into executable SQL statements. It is particularly useful for data analysts and non-technical users who need to interact with databases.

Key Features:

* Supports SQL generation for a wide range of database schemas.

* Provides a validation mechanism for generated SQL queries.
