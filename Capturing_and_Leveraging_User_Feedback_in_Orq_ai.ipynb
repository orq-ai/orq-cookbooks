        "## **Capturing and Leveraging Feedback in Chatbots**\n",
        "This cookbook covers how to seamlessly log and manage user feedback in your FAQ chatbot using Orq.ai. Whether you're tracking quality issues, user actions, or overall sentiment, structured feedback logging helps you continuously improve responses and enhance user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of relying on vague insights or manual reviews, Orq.ai’s feedback logging system allows you to:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Capture **real-time user ratings** (good/bad) on chatbot responses\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Log specific defects** like grammatical errors, hallucinations, or ambiguity\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Maintain structured conversation history to **refine future responses**\n",
        "\n",
        "By integrating feedback logging, you create a chatbot that learns from user input and evolves over time—no guesswork, just data-driven improvements!\n",

        "####**Step 1: Install Dependencies**\n",
        "\n",
        "Before starting, ensure you have an Orq account. If not, sign up first. Replace the API key, and you’re ready to go. For more advanced topics, check out the Orq documentation.\n",
